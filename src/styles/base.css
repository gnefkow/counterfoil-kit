  --------
  This file is the **Tailwind plumbing layer** for the application.

  Its role is to:
  - Activate Tailwind’s base, component, and utility layers
  - Explicitly bind Tailwind to the project’s config via @config
  - Contain only framework-facing setup, not design meaning

  What this file intentionally does NOT do:
  - It does NOT define colors, spacing, typography, or design tokens
  - It does NOT contain semantic meaning or brand decisions
  - It does NOT import semantic token files

  Design meaning lives elsewhere.

  This separation is intentional:
  - Keeping Tailwind setup “boring” and replaceable
  - Preventing design semantics from being buried in framework plumbing
  - Making it easy to reason about what is custom vs what is infrastructure

  If you are looking for:
  - Color definitions
  - Theme semantics (primary, secondary, surface, etc.)
  - Light/dark mode values

  See: semanticTokens.css

  NOTE:
  Tailwind v4 requires an explicit @config directive in the input CSS
  in order to read a custom configuration file. Because PostCSS enforces
  strict @import ordering, semantic tokens are loaded separately at the
  application entry point rather than inside this file.
