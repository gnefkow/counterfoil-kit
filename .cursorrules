This project follows a strict modular design philosophy.

Core constraints:
- No monolithic or “god” files
- Components must be small and composable
- Styling is semantic and abstracted via tokens/utilities
- Logic is separated from presentation
- Assume a real application, not a demo

The canonical, detailed philosophy lives in:
0_resources/design_philosophy.md

When in doubt, defer to that document.
