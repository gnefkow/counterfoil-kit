# Counterfoil Primer — Chapter Template (Required)

Every chapter file in `chapters/` should read like a non-fiction book chapter: an argument with a point of view, written primarily in paragraphs. The goal is coherence (voice, boundaries, and through-line), not a rigid “documentation” feel.

## The non-negotiables

Each chapter must do three things. First, it must name the team constraint that makes this topic matter. Second, it must explain what the thing is and why it exists without drifting into “how-to” instruction. Third, it must connect forward by showing why the next chapter is needed.

## The shape of a chapter

Start with the title, then two or three opening paragraphs that state the thesis and the problem context. After that, use only light structure: a few short subheaders are fine, but the content under each should be prose, not outlines. If you feel the urge to create a list, try to write it as a paragraph first; use bullet lists only when the clarity benefit is overwhelming.

A typical chapter will include sections like “The problem,” “What it is,” “Tradeoffs,” and “Alternatives,” but those labels are not sacred. Use whatever subheaders make the argument flow, while keeping the reader oriented.

## Required ending

End with a short “Bridge forward” in paragraph form that explains what question remains unanswered without the next chapter. Then include a single line:

Next: `NN_next_slug.md`

## Guardrails (to avoid drifting into documentation)

This is not a practical guide. Avoid step-by-step sequences, command walkthroughs, or API tours unless a tiny bit of mechanism is the minimum needed to illuminate a tradeoff. Prefer “why” and “what it costs” over “how.” Use Counterfoil as a concrete example only when it clarifies a concept, and allow critique rather than assuming it is best.
